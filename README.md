    PingCRM on Vite Rails
  </a>
</h1>

[original demo]: https://github.com/ledermann/pingcrm
[vite rails]: https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite_rails
[js_from_routes]: https://github.com/ElMassimo/js_from_routes
[vite-plugin-full-reload]: https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-full-reload
[webpacker]: https://github.com/rails/webpacker
[vite]: http://vitejs.dev/
[Windi CSS]: https://windicss.org/

Unlike the [original demo], this replaces [webpacker] with [Vite Rails],
which provides a substantially faster development experience.

It also leverages [<kbd>js_from_routes</kbd>][js_from_routes] to auto-generate API methods to effortlessly integrate with the Rails backend, which works nicely in combination with <kbd>[vite-plugin-full-reload]</kbd>

Styles are powered by [Windi CSS], a faster alternative to Tailwind CSS.
